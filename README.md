# AI Articles to Wordpress API endpoint

Takes a defined prompt asking OpenAI for topics on a defined topic, connects to the OpenAI API,
then asks OpenAI for articles based on the topics returned.  The article then gets posted to a
Wordpress API endpoint.

Define your API credentials and site API URL in a .env file within the current directory.
Modify the prompts as needed.
